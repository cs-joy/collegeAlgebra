 
# Algebra with Python<p>
This syllabus is the full course, designed as a one-semester college course, with all of the links and resources you need listed here in order. Most of this course will involve videos and Google Colaboratory notebooks. As you go throught each part of this course in sequence, watching each video and working through each Colab notebook, you will gain a full understanding of Algebra and how to write Python code to solve your Algebra problems. Throughout this course, you will also build your own Algebra notebook that you will be able to use as your custom super calculator. This course (and the code you write here) will give you the foundation for deeper math, including data science.<p>

## Week 1 - Ratios and Proportions<p>
Your journey begins here as you learn the math, learn the code, and build your notebook. After the videos, you will see links to the Google Colab notebooks used in those videos. Copy and use whatever code you need to enhance your notebook. This first video includes an introduction to the course, how it will work, and how to use Google Colaboratory. The math and code content will come next.<p>

### Your homemade Python Math notebook 
Put all of your projects, and any other functions or formulas you want, into one Colab notebook. Be sure to make sections with headings so that you have a table of contents. Now you understand the math and the code, and you have a resource that you built. Use it to solve problems, graph data, and calculate anything you want.

The next course will build upon the skills you learned here. You will learn more ways to get data and more mathematical operations to transform and analyze that data in different ways. Continue to build your personal Colab notebook, adding new formulas and functions.<p>
